- **Gateway URL:** https://security-gateway-0xd0v9msee.gateway.bedrock-agentcore.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mcp

## Usage Instructions

### AWS Console Testing
1. Navigate to AWS Bedrock Console
2. Go to Agents section
3. Select 'security-assessment-agent'
4. Use the test interface to interact with the agent
5. Try queries like: 'Check my security services in us-east-1'

### Sample Interactions

**User:** Check my security services configuration
**Agent:** I'll check your AWS security services configuration. The analysis shows that SecurityHub, GuardDuty, Config, and CloudTrail are all enabled in your account, which is excellent for maintaining security visibility.

**User:** Get high severity security findings
**Agent:** I found 3 high severity security findings that require attention: S3 bucket with public read access, EC2 security group allowing unrestricted SSH, and unused IAM access keys. I recommend addressing these issues promptly.

**User:** Analyze my overall security posture
**Agent:** Your security posture score is 78/100. Strong areas include identity & access management (85) and infrastructure security (80). Areas for improvement include data protection (72) and incident response (70). Key recommendations include enabling MFA for all users and implementing automated security scanning.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
- Test the agent with various security assessment queries
- Verify OAuth authentication is working properly
- Monitor CloudWatch logs for any issues

### Future Enhancements
- Implement real AWS API calls instead of mock responses
- Add more security assessment tools (Inspector, Macie, etc.)
- Set up automated security scanning schedules
- Create custom security compliance frameworks

## Cost Estimation

**Estimated Monthly Cost:** $31-155 per month
